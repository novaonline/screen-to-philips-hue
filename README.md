# Screen To Philips Hue

A small project that projects the main screen's average color onto a philips hue lightbulb or strip. This little background app is ideal for watching movies.

## What are my options?

At `config/app.json` you'll find all the options available to you.

``` json
{
    "colorAverage": {
        "delay": 2000 // the time it'll take to process the next average (in milliseconds)
    },
    "hue":{
        "lightId": 5, // the light id
        "transitiontime": 2000, // the time it'll take to transition from color to color (in milliseconds)
        "username": "[Some Random String]" // the username generated by the hue api. This is used to authenticate a app.
    }
}
```

There are plans to add alot more options.

## How do I run it?

Please use git bash

1. Navigate to the local repo
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run clean-start`
